# KP Kustoms

## Overview
<!-- What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences. -->
KP Kustoms is the one stop shop for purchasing handmade one of a kind crochet pieces. 

### Problem
<!-- Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons. -->
KP Kustoms is designed t o fill the gap between professionalism and expensive fees in hosting a website for a small business. Etsy is the leading platform for small business but charges high fees that cut into already small profit margins. Selling on social media is free, however it lacks the professionalism and reliablity of a true website. KP Kustoms will allow for my small business to thrive in a professional setting without costing me monthly fees.
